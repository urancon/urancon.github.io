Despite all of its flaws, YouTube is a great place for scientific content creators to share their work, and for us to enjoy.
This is non-exhaustive personal selection of my favorite science channels and videos.
I am missing other great channels for sure ! I still hope you'll like it! :)

English
======
- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown):
You probably already know this channel. It's THE math channel. Crystal clear explanations and lessons for everyone, with great animations.
- [Artem Kirsanov](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtemKirsanov):
A rather recent channel that I just discovered. In a nutshell, the 3B1B of computational neuroscience.
- [RitvikMath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath):
A channel that saved my life in college. I come back to it every now and then. A lot of data science content and great energy.
- [Up and Atom](https://www.youtube.com/@upandatom/)
A Very nice and well-known physics channel. Less technical than other recommendations in this list, but just as enjoyable!
- [Eric Rowland](https://www.youtube.com/@EricRowland):
A less famous, but not less excellent math content creator. Very few uploads, but real gems every time. 
- [MutualInformation](https://www.youtube.com/@Mutual_Information)
Very refreshing deep learning and numerical analysis.

French

- [ScienceEtonnante](https://www.youtube.com/@ScienceEtonnante)
My favourite best generalist vulgarization channel.
- [Fouloscopie](https://www.youtube.com/@Fouloscopie)
A channel hold by an academic researcher on computational crowd behavior modeling. EXTREMELY inspiring and interdisciplinary.
- [MrPhi](https://www.youtube.com/@MonsieurPhi)
A famous philosophy channel.
- [Hygiène Mentale](https://www.youtube.com/@HygieneMentale)
The go-to channel to discover "zététique", i.e. modern scientific skepticism
- [La Tronche en Biais](https://www.youtube.com/@TroncheEnBiais)
Another "zététique" channel with more content (debates, live streams, news, etc.)
- ...

Nerdy PhD humor
------
- [xkcd what if](https://www.youtube.com/@xkcd_whatif)
Ask nonsense questions and answer them with science. If you like this content, buy Randall Munroe's book!
- [CGP grey](https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey)
A bunch of very fun and nerdy videos.
-[MrPSolver](https://www.youtube.com/@MrPSolver)
You can try and watch the ["Publishing a scientific paper be like..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdMbJ8vTcZw) video for this one.
