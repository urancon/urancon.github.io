One could think that because they are binary and extremely sparse, DVS event streams would not contain much information about the visual scene. But contrary to this belief, they do !
Here is a reconstruction of a depth map from two stereoscopic event cameras made by our SNN model called StereoSpike, on the MVSEC dataset.
